Board: Pimoroni Presto

Micropython script: vector_clock_full_v2.py

IDE: Thonny

Notes @PaulskPt: added following functionalities: 
1) to get ntp datetimestamp at at start and next at set interval. See NTP_UPDATE_INTERVAL at line 19.
3) in the main loop added time calculations to control the ntp refresh interval;
2) circular change of the clock face aspect colours. At hours between 22pm and 7am the brightest clock face will not be shown.
   During these night hours also reversed colours will be used.
3) optional wait for 0 seconds at startup (boolean flag "do_startwait" at line 59);
4) wdDict (weekday dictionary). Print day of the week (serial output only);
5) print day of the year (serial output only)
5) print timezone. See function pr_dt() (serial output only);
